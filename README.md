# Welcome to my client-server web application!

## In this readme file, I provide you with some information about the backend side of my application.

I hope it will help you truly appreciate the executed work. I really invest a piece of yourself in this project, and I hope you will really enjoy it. :) So, let's start with an introduction!

I've decided to develop a web tamagotchi application (so it was a good task from the Innowise team) where you can store and manage your virtual pets. During the process of completing this task, I've improved my knowledge in .NET and MVC technologies. Let's talk a little bit about the technology stack I used in my application.
